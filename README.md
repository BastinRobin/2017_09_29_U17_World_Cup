This is the code and data for a slideshow on the Football Under-17 World Cup to be published on [wionews.com](http://www.wionews.com). You can also see it live [here](https://shijithpk.github.io/2017_09_29_U17_World_Cup/).

All the data is taken from [Technical Study Group reports](http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/official-documents/development/technical-study-group-reports/index.html) published by FIFA after every tournament. Specifically, I used the reports on the World Cup in Brazil in [2014](http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/02/42/15/40/2014fwc_tsg_report_15082014web_neutral.pdf#page=173) and the Under-17 World Cup in Chile in [2015](http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/02/74/76/76/fifau-17chile2015web_neutral.pdf#page=98).

Used a modified version of the [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) library and D3.js to make this slideshow. 

Used a lot of code snippets from stackoverflow.com, have credited them in the code when possible.
